# samples

* The sample files with _red suffix have been reduced to save space. Some fields have been deleted and some arrays have been decimated. These files are suitable for limited testing only.
* The sample files shown here with .dvc extension are stored in nfs mount through iris or omega. Run `dvc pull` to get the data files downloaded. Note that this will only work from inside the fusion network. See [TestSamples](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/TestSamples#readme) for more details.
